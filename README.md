# Luos: robotic product development made easy
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/pollen/luos.svg?token=RxFY2cvxnBdyPk3Jevf4&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/pollen/luos)

Luos is a end-to-end system to fully orchestrate your robot, all the way from hardware control to high level behaviors and Apps management. 

It includes out of the box sensors acquisitions and filtering drivers, advanced motor control for precise and eye-pleasing smooth motion, most commonly used robotic and AI algorithm and so on.

Its sandboxed multi-layer architectures and elegant APIs allow for efficient and productive programming.

## Architecture

TODO @pierre-rouanet

maybe explain drivers, luos-core, traits and so on 

## Development

Luos is lightweight, it can run on low-cost microcontroller (from ARM Cortex M0).

It is currently developped on STM32F0 ÂµC, you can use the following development board to test and use Luos.

- [Luos L0 (available soon)](https://www.luos.io/)
- [NUCLEO-F072RB](http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f072rb.html)
- [32F072BDISCOVERY](http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/32f072bdiscovery.html)
