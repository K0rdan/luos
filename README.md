# Luos: robotic product development made easy
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pollen-robotics/luos.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pollen-robotics/luos)

Luos is an end-to-end system to fully orchestrate your robot, all the way from hardware control to high level behaviors and Apps management.

It includes out of the box sensors acquisitions and filtering, drivers for advanced motor control for precise and eye-pleasing smooth motion. In the future, most commonly used robotic and AI algorithms will also be available.

Its sandboxed multi-layer architectures and elegant APIs allows for efficient and productive programming.

**[more information on our website>>](https://www.luos.io/)**

## Architecture

Luos is coded in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and built around 2 main concepts:
* **drivers** defines standardized API as Rust traits for common robotics parts (e.g. a servo motor, a position encoder, a distance sensor, etc.). This enforces compatibility amongst drivers and let you seamlessly switch from one actuator/sensor implementation to another without breaking the rest of your code. 
* **core** represents a physical boards and its associated local drivers. It handles automatically the communication with the other cores - and thus the remote drivers - so you can develop your project with a modular approach.

## Development

Luos is lightweight, it can run on low-cost microcontrollers. 

We currently use the ARM Cortex M0 and develop on STM32F0 ÂµC, you can use the following development board to test and use Luos.

- [Luos L0 (available soon)](https://www.luos.io/)
- [NUCLEO-F072RB](http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f072rb.html)
- [32F072BDISCOVERY](http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/32f072bdiscovery.html)
