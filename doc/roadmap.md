# Roadmap

This is the global development roadmap of Pollen Robotics. This document is updated weekly.
If you have any question please feel free to ask us on [our forum](https://forum.luos.io/).

project list :
 - [**Robus**](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/robus) : Robus is a ligthweight & low-cost yet powerful modular network made to unify communications between components in hardware products.
 - [**Luos**](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/luos) : Luos is an end-to-end system to fully orchestrate your robot, all the way from hardware control to high level behaviors and Apps management.
 - **L0** : A tiny board used as base for your robot hardware modules
 - **L0 shield** : Shields allowing the L0 to manage devices (sensors, motors, batteries, computer, ...)
 - **month robot** : each month we create a robot elected by the community
